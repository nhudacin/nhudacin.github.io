I've been breaking computers since we got our first Gateway in the 90's. Oh the good ol' days... Staying home from school to play Counter Strike, spending entire nights working on our clan website. <i> "Script Kiddies" </i> was not a term back then but it does bring back memories. Ha! Now I spend my days coding and my nights hanging out with my family. It's a good life!

I started my career out in the SQL Server world... Automating massively complex database migrations. It was a lot of hard work, but a great experience that prepared me for the real world. Recently, I was offered an opportunity to work on continuous delivery and infrastructure automation.

I'm only a few months into this endeavor and I'm loving it! The mainstream tools have all been built for *nix environments and are <i> "ported" </i> back to Windows with limited, if any functionality. This means that I have to use a wide variety of tools, code, and practices to accomplish even the simplest of tasks. That's why I started this blog, to highlight some of my day-to-day challenges and what I did to get around them. Nowhere will I claim to have the <b> BEST </b> answer, so remember... <b> YMMV!! </b>


Thanks for reading!
